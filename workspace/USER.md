## Basics

- **Name:** Darren Zal
- **What to call them:** Darren
- **Email:** *(set your email here)*
- **Timezone:** PST (Pacific Standard Time)
- **Location:** Greater Victoria, Southern Vancouver Island, Salish Sea bioregion. Traditional lands of the Lək̓ʷəŋən and WSÁNEĆ peoples.
- **Education:** BSc Physics & Computer Science, McGill University (2014)

## Who He Is

Entrepreneur, activist, cosmo-localist. Focused on large-scale systems transformation to address interconnected global challenges and facilitate a flourishing future for life on Earth.

He operates at the intersection of AI, regenerative finance, knowledge graphs, and decentralized systems. He is a builder who thinks systemically.

He moved to this place and fell in love with it — the ocean, the mountains, the forests. Then learned what was lost. The herring, the salmon, the old-growth. Felt the connection walking into ancient forest. That experience led him to Kwaxala — forest protection. Once you feel that connection, you cannot unfeel it.

## Current Roles

### Steward — Greater Victoria Landscape Group
Systems design & technology lead for the Greater Victoria landscape group, one of six Salish Sea groups and ten across Cascadia. Building the Living Atlas — semantic knowledge graph as instrument of bioregional perception. Collaborating with Polly Orr (food systems) and Clare Attwell (bioregional weaving).

### Founder & AI Developer — Gaia AI / Symbiocene Labs
Co-founder leading core development for a guild of interoperable AI agents working alongside humans to solve systemic challenges in ecological and economic domains.

### KOI Developer & BD Sprint Lead — Regen AI / Regen Network
Building Knowledge Organization Infrastructure (KOI) — a decentralized knowledge network. Entity resolution with semantic matching. MCP servers for Claude integration. Custom agent services for regenerative finance clients.

### System Architect — Kwaxala
Founding team designing the "Living Forest" investment system. Protects at-risk forests by buying out logging licenses and retiring them. "Worth more standing" — accounts for forests as living ecosystems, not timber.

## Key Projects

### Salish Sea Bioregion
- **Living Atlas** — Semantic knowledge graph for bioregional perception (KOI + Murmurations + ValueFlows)
- **Salish Sea Dreaming** — Immersive AI art installation with Briony Penn & MOVE37XR (Salt Spring Island, April 2026)
- **BioFi** — Bioregional financing. "Our network is our net worth." Herring worth more swimming than caught.
- **Story of Place** — Oral histories weaving the bioregion's meta-story
- **Kumu Network Map** — 40 entities, 50+ connections across watersheds, First Nations, learning centers

### Broader
- **re/acc Commons** — Regenerative Accelerationist network nation (reacc.xyz). Living constitution, agent-native governance, membrane architecture.
- **Regen AI** — KOI knowledge infrastructure, registry review agents, CTO agent, data permissioning
- **IndigenomicsAI** — Sovereign AI infrastructure for Indigenous economic worldviews. Collaboration with Carol Anne Hilton / Indigenomics Institute.
- **Kwaxala** — Living Forest investment system for Indigenous forest stewardship

## Areas of Expertise

- AI & software architecture (interoperable agents, MCP, knowledge graphs)
- Regenerative finance & token engineering
- Systems design (complex decentralized systems, living systems economics)
- Blockchain & Web3 (community currencies, DAOs, open value flows)
- Bioregionalism, cosmo-localism, knowledge commoning
- Semantic technologies (RDF, SPARQL, entity resolution, discourse graphs)

## Intellectual Foundations

- **Cosmo-localism** — "What is heavy is local, what is light is global and shared"
- **Edge-centric economics** — The value is what flows through relationships, not what can be extracted from nodes
- **Three-Eyed Seeing** — Western science + Indigenous knowledge + land as knower
- **Bioregional knowledge commoning** — The land has its own intelligence
- **Shifting baseline syndrome** — Each generation accepts the depleted state as normal
- **Freedom through entanglement** — 21st century freedom is expansion through recognized interdependence
- **T'lep intelligence** — The octopus as model of distributed cognition (9 brains, witness + executive)

## Key Collaborators

- **Clare Attwell** — Bioregional weaving (Victoria Landscape Group)
- **Briony Penn** — Illustrator, circular calendars, Salish Sea Dreaming

### Regen / Gaia
- **Gregory Landua** — Regen Network strategy & partnerships
- **Shawn Anderson** — Regen AI infrastructure lead
- **Samuel / Samu Barnes** — Marketing & community
- **Susanna Choe** — Gaia AI, UN civic participation
- **Marie** — CTO Agent collaboration

### Indigenous
- **Carol Anne Hilton** — Indigenomics Institute

## Working Style

- Direct communicator. Skip the fluff.
- Builder first, theorist second — but the theory matters.
- Thinks in systems, feedback loops, and leverage points.
- Values action over planning, but plans when the stakes are high.
- Runs multiple projects simultaneously — context switching is normal.
- Uses Obsidian for knowledge management with extensive entity linking.
- Claude Code is his primary development environment.

## What Matters To Him

The transition from extraction to life. Not abstractly — concretely, through building infrastructure that compounds. Knowledge commons, bioregional financing, cooperative governance, AI agents grounded in regenerative principles.

The Salish Sea. The herring, the salmon, the orcas, the old-growth, the peoples who tended this place for millennia. Worth more standing. Worth more swimming. The value is what flows through relationships.

He is collapse-aware but builds anyway. Post-tragic audacity.
