## The BKC CoIP — Your Community of Practice

The **Bioregional Knowledge Commons (BKC) Community of Inquiry & Practice (CoIP)** is a collaborative initiative launched by r3.0 in early 2025, focused on building shared knowledge infrastructure for bioregional organizing worldwide.

**Current project:** "Mapping Bioregional Practices & Patterns in Knowledge Commons" — a systematic effort to interview bioregional groups globally, document their regenerative practices, and identify trans-bioregional patterns through a pattern mining methodology.

**Status (as of Feb 2026):** Moving forward pre-funding. Primary Research Team formed. Proposal restructured from Modules into Seed/Emergence/Growth phases. Budget being developed. First interviews being planned.

## Core Concepts

### What Is a Bioregion?

A bioregion is a "life-place" defined by ecological and cultural dimensions — "a geographic terrain and a terrain of consciousness" (Peter Berg). Not a political boundary, but a living system defined by:
- Watersheds and hydrological systems
- Geology, topography, soil, climate
- Flora, fauna, ecosystems
- Human settlements, cultures, and ways of knowing

Bioregioning is the active, participatory process of living regeneratively within a bioregion — not a static "ism" but an ongoing engagement with reinhabitation and place-based change.

### What Is a Knowledge Commons?

A knowledge commons is the institutionalized community governance of sharing (and co-creating) intellectual and cultural resources — information, findings, knowledge, data, and intangible assets. Core principles:
1. **Shared governance** — community-led management of knowledge resources
2. **Accessibility** — knowledge available to all members for collective benefit
3. **Evidence-based operation** — drawing on Elinor Ostrom's commons governance research

### What Is Bioregional Knowledge Commoning?

The practice of collectively creating, stewarding, and sharing knowledge at the bioregional scale as a commons. Two layers:

- **Local Knowledge Commons**: Ecological knowledge, cultural practices, governance — stewarded by individual bioregions
- **Meta Knowledge Commons**: Shared patterns, cross-bioregional collaboration, co-created tools and methodologies

### The Seven Knowledge Challenges

These are the problems the BKC project is working to solve:

1. **Scattered knowledge** — practices and insights fragmented with no coherent access
2. **No pattern validation** — the assumption that common patterns exist across bioregions has never been systematically tested
3. **Missing commons infrastructure** — knowledge held collectively but lacks repositories, protocols, and social agreements
4. **Isolation of practitioners** — can't easily learn from peers in other regions
5. **Scale gap** — no mechanism to bridge local action with trans-local pattern recognition
6. **Weak knowledge sovereignty** — integrity of knowledge requires steward control over access, especially for Indigenous knowledge
7. **Invisibilized/misappropriated Indigenous knowledge** — Indigenous knowledge deployed for millennia but often invisibilized, unintegrated, or misappropriated

### Foundational Commitments (The Three Pillars)

1. **Knowledge Sovereignty** — governance infrastructure in social and technical systems to empower stewards and safeguard knowledge from misuse
2. **Epistemic Justice** — respect for diverse epistemologies, countering colonialist extraction and epistemicide (Vanessa Andreotti's framework on modernity/coloniality)
3. **Ontological Pluriversality** — honoring diverse ontologies (Bollier & Helfrich's "OntoShift", Escobar & Kothari's pluriversality), decolonializing the universalization of Western ontology

---

## The Pattern Mining Methodology

The project uses a methodology developed by **David Bollier & Silke Helfrich** in *Free, Fair & Alive* (2019), based on **Christopher Alexander's Pattern Language**.

### How It Works

1. **Identify practices** — through interviews, document the specific regenerative practices bioregional groups employ
2. **Catalog practices** — structure them using a shared schema with standardized fields
3. **Mine for patterns** — analyze practices in aggregate to discern recurring patterns (reusable solutions to common problems that appear across contexts)
4. **Validate patterns** — cross-check with interviewed bioregions for accuracy
5. **Share patterns** — populate federated knowledge commons, cross-linking between local practices and global patterns

### Key Insight

The assumption that practices applied at the bioregional scale will aggregate into meaningful patterns at the trans-bioregional scale is **untested**. This project is the first systematic attempt to validate whether pattern mining works for bioregional practices.

### The Triad of Commoning

From Bollier & Helfrich — three interconnected spheres of commoning:
- **Social Life** — cultivating shared purpose, values, trust
- **Peer Governance** — self-organization, consent-based decision-making
- **Provisioning** — creating and sharing resources, tools, infrastructure

Bioregioning is a form of commoning. The question is: are bioregional groups consciously/deliberately engaging in commoning practices informed by these patterns?

### Pattern Language (Christopher Alexander)

Patterns are not rules — they are descriptions of problems and solutions that recur in specific contexts. A pattern language is a network of patterns that support each other, creating a living whole greater than the parts.

## Andrea Farias's Research

Andrea's foundational research: *Bioregional Knowledge Commons — A Meta Perspective: Federated Knowledge Infrastructure for Place-Based Organizing* (published May 2025 by r3.0).

### What She Built
- Collected **117+ publicly available sources** documenting bioregional organizing worldwide (YouTube transcripts, reports, websites)
- Developed **59 detailed case studies** of bioregional initiatives
- Created **57 organization profiles**
- Built **data schema and standards** for structured knowledge documentation
- Prototyped in **Obsidian** (markdown database with map & table views) and **Notion** (AI-assisted database)
- Case studies written with AI assistance; only 3 manually edited so far

### Three Audience Layers
1. **Bioregional Organizing Teams** — place-based groups actively implementing regenerative practices
2. **Learning Networks** — organizations connecting multiple teams for peer learning
3. **Indigenous Knowledge Holders & Practitioners** — stewarding knowledge for millennia

### Key Insight
She identified three layers of technical infrastructure needed:
1. **Interface layer** — publishing/public-facing (map, table, pattern displays)
2. **Data management layer** — privacy, access controls, sovereignty
3. **Input layer** — data collection from practitioners

---

## Technical Architecture

### Current Approach
- **Obsidian** as primary database (markdown files, most accessible, no vendor lock-in)
- **Markdown (.md)** as core data format (broad compatibility, data sovereignty)
- **Map view** — geographic interface visualizing bioregional efforts across territories
- **Table view** — structured database for filtering, sorting, searching
- **Tech-agnostic** — project recommends bioregions choose tools fitting their needs

### OMNI-Mapping Assessment
Three layers being defined:
1. Interface layer (publishing/public-facing)
2. Data management layer (privacy, access controls)
3. Input layer (data collection)

Plus: protocols and standards for how data moves from private to public.

### Darren's Technical Contributions
- **KOI** (Knowledge Organization Infrastructure) — decentralized knowledge network from Block Science
- **Entity resolution** — Exact → Fuzzy (Jaro-Winkler) → Semantic (embeddings) → Create new
- **Living Atlas** — semantic knowledge graph as instrument of bioregional perception
- **MCP servers** — Claude integration for knowledge graph queries, ledger data
- Feedback on knowledge sovereignty and Indigenous leadership in technical architecture

### Future Possibilities
- **AI Chatbot** (this is you!) — helping users navigate and query the knowledge base. Must respect knowledge sovereignty and not oversimplify context-specific knowledge
- **Input widgets** — enabling practitioners to clip/share content from their websites
- **Federated architecture** — local knowledge commons cross-linking to meta knowledge commons
- **Catalist platform** — OMNI-Mapping's online platform for some visualization needs

## Indigenous Knowledge — Handle with Care

Eli Ingraham's critical feedback (essential to internalize):

> "Indigenous folks are likely carrying on their practices, per usual. It is non-Indigenous folks that are changing their ways."

> "This knowledge has existed for millennia, but is 'held' by Indigenous peoples in sacred trust."

> "Indigenous Knowledge Systems are very different from ours. There is secular knowledge and sacred knowledge. Each is accessed and shared via different protocols that involve age, gender, and role."

> "The real knowledge lies within the minds and hands and hearts of those closest to the ground, not in discoverable databases."

### Key Principles
- Indigenous communities have been doing bioregioning for millennia — bioregionalism is not new to them
- Sacred and secular knowledge have different access protocols
- Relationship-building comes first, always
- OCAP principles: Ownership, Control, Access, Possession
- Greater Tkaronto Bioregion has been developing Indigenous Knowledge Commons with Dr. Dan Longboat
- WariNkwi Flores (Indigenous Commons) and Melanie Goodchild are pending advisors
- See: Tyson Yunkaporta & Melanie Goodchild, *Protocols for Non-Indigenous People Working with Indigenous Knowledge*

### Local (Salish Sea / Greater Victoria)
- Steward of the **Greater Victoria Landscape Group** (one of six around the Salish Sea, ten across Cascadia)
- Part of **Regenerate Cascadia** network (Brandon Letsinger & Clare Attwell)
- **Landscape Hub Cultivator** Phase 1 Showcase — presented "We are the Salish Sea, Learning to See Itself" (Feb 2026)
- Key projects: Living Atlas, Salish Sea Dreaming, BioFi, Kwaxala, Story of Place
- Collaborators: Polly Orr (food systems), Clare Attwell (bioregional weaving), Briony Penn (naturalist/author)

### Global (BKC COP)
- Team member on the Practices & Patterns Project
- Technical architecture advisor (KOI, knowledge graphs, entity resolution, data sovereignty)
- Advocate for knowledge sovereignty and Indigenous leadership in technical decisions
- Connected to Regen AI / KOI infrastructure that could serve as technical backbone

### The Bridge
Darren's unique contribution is bridging the **local bioregional practice** (Greater Victoria / Salish Sea) with the **global meta-knowledge commons** (BKC COP) — and doing so through **technical infrastructure** (KOI, knowledge graphs, MCP) that embodies the principles of knowledge sovereignty and federation.
